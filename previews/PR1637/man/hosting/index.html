through the <a href="../guide/#Package-Guide">Package Guide</a> and <a href="../doctests/#Doctests">Doctests</a> page you will need to host the generated documentation somewhere for potential users to read. This guide will describe how to set up automatic updates for your package docs using either the Travis CI build service or GitHub Actions together with GitHub Pages for hosting the generated HTML files. This is the same approach used by this package to host its own docs – the docs you&#39;re currently reading.</p><div class="admonition is-info"><header class="admonition-header">Note</header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Following this guide should be the <em>final</em> step you take after you are comfortable with the syntax and build process used by <code>Documenter.jl</code>. It is recommended that you only proceed with the steps outlined here once you have successfully managed to build your documentation locally with Documenter.</p><p>This guide assumes that you already have <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis</a> accounts setup.

In general it is easiest to choose the same service as the one testing your package. If you don&#39;t explicitly select the service with the <code>deploy_config</code> keyword argument to <code>deploydocs</code> Documenter will try to automatically detect which system is running and use that.</p>Documenter.Anchors.Anchor(Markdown.Header{2}(Any[&quot;Travis CI&quot;]), 69, &quot;build/man/hosting.md&quot;, &quot;Travis-CI&quot;, 1)<p>To tell Travis that we want a new build stage, we can add the following to an existing <code>.travis.yml</code> file.

Travis &lt;: DeployConfig
```

Default implementation of `DeployConfig`.

The following environment variables influences the build when using the `Travis` configuration:

  * `DOCUMENTER_KEY`: must contain the Base64-encoded SSH private key for the repository. This variable should be set in the Travis settings for the repository. Make sure this variable is marked **NOT** to be displayed in the build log.
  * `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST`: must be set to `false`. This avoids deployment on pull request builds.
  * `TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG`: must match the value of the `repo` keyword to [`deploydocs`](../lib/public.md#Documenter.deploydocs).
  * `TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE`: may not be set to `cron`. This avoids re-deployment of existing docs on builds that were triggered by a Travis cron job.
  * `TRAVIS_BRANCH`: unless `TRAVIS_TAG` is non-empty, this must have the same value as the `devbranch` keyword to [`deploydocs`](../lib/public.md#Documenter.deploydocs). This makes sure that only the development branch (commonly, the `master` branch) will deploy the &quot;dev&quot; documentation (deployed into a directory specified by the `devurl` keyword to [`deploydocs`](../lib/public.md#Documenter.deploydocs)).
  * `TRAVIS_TAG`: if set, a tagged version deployment is performed instead; the value must be a valid version number (i.e. match `Base.VERSION_REGEX`). The documentation for a package version tag gets deployed to a directory named after the version number in `TRAVIS_TAG` instead.

The `TRAVIS_*` variables are set automatically on Travis. More information on how Travis sets the `TRAVIS_*` variables can be found in the [Travis documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables).

Implementation of `DeployConfig` for deploying from GitHub Actions.

The following environment variables influences the build when using the `GitHubActions` configuration:

  * `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`: must be set to `push`. This avoids deployment on pull request builds.
  * `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: must match the value of the `repo` keyword to [`deploydocs`](../lib/public.md#Documenter.deploydocs).
  * `GITHUB_REF`: must match the `devbranch` keyword to [`deploydocs`](../lib/public.md#Documenter.deploydocs), alternatively correspond to a git tag.
  * `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `DOCUMENTER_KEY`: used for authentication with GitHub, see the manual section for [GitHub Actions](hosting.md#GitHub-Actions) for more information.

The `GITHUB_*` variables are set automatically on GitHub Actions, see the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables#default-environment-variables).

GitLab &lt;: DeployConfig

GitLab implementation of `DeployConfig`.

The following environment variables influence the build when using the `GitLab` configuration:

  * `DOCUMENTER_KEY`: must contain the Base64-encoded SSH private key for the repository. This variable should be set in the GitLab settings. Make sure this variable is marked **NOT** to be displayed in the build log.
  * `CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`: the name of the commit branch.
  * `CI_EXTERNAL_PULL_REQUEST_IID`: Pull Request ID from GitHub if the pipelines are for external pull requests.
  * `CI_PROJECT_PATH_SLUG`: The namespace with project name. All letters lowercased and non-alphanumeric characters replaced with `-`.
  * `CI_COMMIT_TAG`: The commit tag name. Present only when building tags.
  * `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE`: Indicates how the pipeline was triggered.

The `CI_*` variables are set automatically on GitLab. More information on how GitLab sets the `CI_*` variables can be found in the [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html).

Buildkite &lt;: DeployConfig
```

Buildkite implementation of `DeployConfig`.

The following environment variables influence the build when using the `Buildkite` configuration:

  * `DOCUMENTER_KEY`: must contain the Base64-encoded SSH private key for the repository. This variable should be somehow set in the CI environment, e.g., provisioned by an agent environment plugin.
  * `BUILDKITE_BRANCH`: the name of the commit branch.
  * `BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST`: Pull Request ID from GitHub if the pipelines are for external pull requests.
  * `BUILDKITE_TAG`: The commit tag name. Present only when building tags.

The `BUILDKITE_*` variables are set automatically on GitLab. More information on how Buildkite sets the `BUILDKITE_*` variables can be found in the [Buildkite documentation](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/environment-variables).
