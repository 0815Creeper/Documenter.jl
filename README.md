# Lapidary

*A documentation generator for Julia.*

Lapidary is currently an unregistered package and so must be installed using

```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/Lapidary.jl")
```

Self-generated package documentation is hosted on *ReadTheDocs.org* and makes for a good
example of what the documentation generated by Lapidary looks like:

The package is tested against Julia `0.4` and *current* `0.5`:

[issue][issues-url] if you encounter any problems.
